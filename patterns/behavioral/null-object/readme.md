# Null Object
 
 NullObject is not a GoF design pattern but a schema which appears
 frequently enough to be considered a pattern. It has the following
 benefits:
 
 -  Client code is simplified
 -  Reduces the chance of null pointer exceptions
 -  Fewer conditionals require less test cases
 
 Methods that return an object or null should instead return an object or
 ``NullObject``. ``NullObject``\ s simplify boilerplate code such as
 ``if (!is_null($obj)) { $obj->callSomething(); }`` to just
 ``$obj->callSomething();`` by eliminating the conditional check in
 client code.
 
+ Examples 
 -  Symfony2: null logger of profiler
 -  Symfony2: null output in Symfony/Console
 -  null handler in a Chain of Responsibilities pattern
 -  null command in a Command pattern
