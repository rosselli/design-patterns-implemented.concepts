# Fluent Interface

+ To **write code that is easy readable just like sentences in a natural language** _(like English)_.

+ Examples
    + Doctrine2's QueryBuilder works something like that example class below
    + PHPUnit uses fluent interfaces to build mock objects
    + Yii Framework: CDbCommand and CActiveRecord use this pattern, too
