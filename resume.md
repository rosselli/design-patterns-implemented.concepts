# Design Patterns: Resume

--- | :---
**Behavioral:** Command | It encapsulates the invocation and decouples.
**Behavioral:** Mediator | It controls the interaction between two objects. They don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation. 
**Behavioral:** Memento | It captures and stores the current state of an object, in a manner that it can be restored later. 
**Behavioral:** NullObject | It returns objects that won't never be null, eliminating the conditional is_null() check.
**Behavioral:** Observer |  
**Behavioral:** Specification | It builds a clear specification of business rules, where objects can be checked against. 
**Behavioral:** State | It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes. 
**Behavioral:** Strategy | It allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation  
**Behavioral:** Visitor | It adds further operations to objects without having to modify them *(open/closed principle)*. 
**Creational:** Multiton | It has a list of named instances that are used, like a singleton but with N instances.
**Creational:** Pool | It uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use (A Pool), rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. 
**Creational:** Singleton | It has only one instance of this object in the application that will handle all calls.
**Structural:** DataMapper | It performs bidirectional transfer of data between a persistent data store and an in memory data representation.
**Structural:** Dependency Injection | It injects an object inside another object, *(normally via constructor)*, reducing the coupling and the need to extend it. 
**Structural:** Fluent Interface | To write code that is easy readable just like sentences in a natural language (like English).
**Structural:** Flyweight | It shares similar objects as much as possible to minimise memory usage.
**Structural:** Proxy | It avoids the instance to execute again the heavy job, already executed by the parent or it is a security layer who opens the door to the functionality. 
**Structural:** Registry | It implements a central storage for objects often used throughout the application.
